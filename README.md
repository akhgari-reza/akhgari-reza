- ðŸ”­ As a mid-level Java developer, every day I try to update my knowledge. My three major job directions include microservices architecture, low-level design i.e. modules and providing suitable solutions for implementation in accordance with client requests. The third and most important part of my job is code reviewing and refactoring, where I always try to improve others implementations using my knowledge and experience. 
- ðŸŒ± To improve and expand technical knowledge, I've currently focued more on topics that I have worked on less. Event driven Design Patterns in Banking Solutions are examples of this attempt.
<!-- âš¡ Fun fact: Russians hired me to travel to Saturn. Well what can I say. I have to work very well ... actually 35 + 1 hours a day. (A day on Saturn is 10.656 hours)!! -->
