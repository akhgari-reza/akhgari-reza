- ðŸ”­ My ability to multitask and high analytical skills allow me to work effectively with large amounts of information. Having the title of tech-savvy Java Developer is the result of relying on activity based on deep knowledge, adaptability to technology, and sufficient work experience in different teams. I am very interested in new technologies around Java, microservice architecture, and also DevOps. Having sufficient skills in all steps of SDLC (software development life cycle), I have always played a positive role in the team. The most important trends and my professional areas are:
- ðŸŒ± OOP â€“ KISS - Clean Code â€“ SOLID â€“ Design Patterns
- ðŸŒ± Event-Driven Architecture
- ðŸŒ± Command and Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS)
- ðŸŒ± Domain-Driven Design
- ðŸŒ± Microservices Patternsâ€“ Cloud Native
- ðŸŒ± Spring Framework as the bible of development
- ðŸŒ± CI/CD methodologies - DevOps Engineering

âš¡ Fun fact: Russians hired me to travel to Saturn. Well what can I say. I have to work very well ... actually 35 + 1 hours a day. (A day on Saturn is 10.656 hours)!!
